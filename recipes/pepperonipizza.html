      <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine the sugar, yeast, and ½ cup of warm water, then whisk until the yeast has dissolved completely.</li>
      <li>eave the mixture to rest for 5-10 minutes, then add the rest of the warm water, olive oil, and salt.</li>
      <li>With the mixer at low speed, slowly add in half of the flour and mix until combined.</li>
      <li>Mix in the rest of the flour and then knead at medium-low speed until a smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky dough is formed.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it to rest in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, approximately 1-2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>For the sauce</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Put all ingredients in a big bowl.</li>
      <li>Mix together with a mixer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>For the pizza</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees (or appropriate temperature if using a pizza oven). We recommend any of the Ooni ovens for making pizza.</li>

      <li>Divide the dough into two equal portions./li>
      <li>Working with one portion of dough at a time, hand-stretch the dough to create a 12-inch round.</li>
      <li>Stretch and pinch the dough to create a slightly thicker rim around the edge. Repeat with the second portion of dough.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil with three minced garlic cloves, then brush over both dough rounds.</li>
      <li>Evenly spread 2/3 cup of pizza sauce over each pizza, leaving the rim bare.</li>
      <li>Top the sauce with mozzarella, parmesan, and slices of pepperoni.</li>
      <li>Place one pizza in the oven and bake for 12-14 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and top with oregano.</li>
      <li>Place the second pizza in the oven and bake for 12-14 minutes, then remove and top with oregano.</li>
